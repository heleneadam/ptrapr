I wrote this vignette mostly for myself, to remind me how to deal with graph representation of panicles in R.

This is not a general introduction about graphs in R. It is a practical note on the graph functions and operations that are used in this package.

We have included examples of such files in this package. You can access these examples **online* [here](https://github.com/othomantegazza/ptrapr) or locally in the `ptrapr/extdata` folder [^find.package]

[^find.package]: Locate your local package folder with the function: `find.folder(ptrapr)`
